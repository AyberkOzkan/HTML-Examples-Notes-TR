    <ul>
    <li><font color="red" face="arial,helvetica">Google returns the right
    results first.</font><br>
    
    Google uses a complicated mathematical analysis, calculated on more
    than a billion hyperlinks on the web, to return high-quality search
    results so you don't have to sift through junk.  This analysis allows
    Google to estimate the quality, or importance, of every web page it
    returns.  The importance of a web page is entirely independent of any
    query.  A page like <tt>www.google.com</tt> has high importance if
    <ol>
    <li> Other pages with high importance point to
         <tt>www.google.com</tt>
    <li> <i>Lots</i> of other pages with high importance point to
         <tt>www.google.com</tt>
    </ol>
    This definition seems circular, and it is.  Nonetheless, it yields a
    well-defined notion of importance that makes finding high quality
    sites easy.<p>
    
    Of course, important pages mean nothing to you if they don't match
    your query, so Google uses sophisticated text-matching techniques to
    find pages that are both important and relevant to your search.  For
    instance, when considering a page, Google looks at what the pages
    linking to that page have to say about it.
    
    
    <li><font color="red" face="arial,helvetica">Google can make you feel
    lucky!</font><br>
    
    For common queries like company names, Google is so good at getting
    the right result first that we've put in an "I'm feeling lucky"
    button.  The "I'm feeling lucky" button takes you directly to the
    first search result.  No more waiting for time consuming search
    results pages to load when you know what you're looking for.
    
    
    <li><font color="red" face="arial,helvetica">Google shows you where
    your query matches.</font><br>
    
    Instead of static summaries of the web pages, Google  gives you an
    excerpt of the text that matches your query -- with your search terms
    in bold -- right in the search results!  This saves you the time and
    frustration of loading a web page that ends up having nothing to do
    with what you had in mind.
    
    
    <li><font color="red" face="arial,helvetica">Google understands that
    location is important.</font><br>
    
    Unlike many other search engines, Google tries to return results
    where your search terms are in close proximity to one another.  This
    is more time-consuming for us, but you spend less time sifting through
    junk results.
    
    
    <li><font color="red" face="arial,helvetica">Google returns pages with
    the terms you typed.</font><br>
    
    Unlike many other search engines, Google only returns pages which match
    <i>all</i> of your search terms, either in the text of the page
    or in the link anchors
    pointing to it.  No more frustration with your search terms not even
    being in the results pages.
    
    
    <li><font color="red" face="arial,helvetica">Google can give you a
    cached copy of the web page.</font><br>
    
    Google keeps a copy of many of the web pages it returns.  If the
    server is down or otherwise not available, Google's copy of the page
    can be a life saver.  Using our cached version can often be much
    faster than following the regular link, though the information you
    receive will be less up to date.  But in many cases, no more
    frustrating <tt>404 Not Found</tt> errors!
